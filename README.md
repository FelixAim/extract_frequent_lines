# extract_frequent_lines
 The Python script efficiently extracts frequently occurring lines from a text file, based on a specified minimum repetition count. Useful for identifying common patterns in large text datasets.

**Tutorial: Using the Python Script to Extract Frequent Lines from Text File**

In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of using the Python script to extract frequent lines from a text file. This script is particularly useful for identifying commonly recurring patterns or data in large text datasets.

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**

First, clone the repository containing the Python script (`extract_frequent_lines.py`) and a sample input file (`input.txt`) to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/extract-frequent-lines.git

**Step 2: Navigate to the Repository**

Change your current directory to the cloned repository.

cd extract-frequent-lines

**Step 3: Prepare the Input File**

Ensure you have a text file (input.txt) with various lines of text. If you don't have one, you can create a new file and add some sample text lines.

**Step 4: Run the Python Script**

Run the Python script with the following command:

python extract_frequent_lines.py

**Step 5: Enter Minimum Repetitions**

The script will prompt you to enter the minimum number of repetitions required for a line to be considered frequent. For example, if you enter 2, the script will extract lines that occur at least twice.

Enter the minimum number of repetitions: 2

**Step 6: Review the Output**

After the script finishes running, you will find a new file named frequent_lines.txt in the same directory. This file contains the extracted frequent lines that met the specified repetition count.

**Step 7: Customize the Script (Optional)**

If you want to adjust the script parameters, such as the input file name or output file name, you can modify the script accordingly.

**Step 8: Explore Different Scenarios**

Feel free to experiment with different input files, adjust the minimum repetition count, and analyze various text samples to observe the script's behavior in different scenarios.

**Step 9: Contribute or Report Issues**

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, you can contribute to the project by creating a pull request or open an issue on GitHub.

Congratulations! You have successfully used the Python script to extract frequent lines from a text file. This tool can be a valuable asset for text data analysis, pattern recognition, and text processing tasks. Happy coding!
